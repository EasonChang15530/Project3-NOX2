# NOX 2

## Overview

This is a MERN application that has a concise and easy to use UI, user can sign up and login, and this user's information will be displayed on the left sidebar. Users' data and posts data are saved in MongoDB, which could be updated and displayed dynamically with the users' creation.

In addition, any user could mark a post once, and if a post is marked more than three times, it will be deleted as an inappropriate post.

It is worth mentioning that the real-time chat function can be implemented. On the chat page, users can chat publicly or chat with a user individually.
