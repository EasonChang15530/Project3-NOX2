# Project 3
Jack Shalenkova, Sean Melvin, Bailing Zhang, Mustafa Muhammad

## Overview
This group's project 3 will continue on the idea that two members (Sean, Jack) began working on in project 2, but rewritten as a MERN app, which they agree would be a more effective way to achieve their goal:
    The app will be a dating and social app specifically designed for queer and trans folks. Because most dating apps are built with straight couples or cisgender gay men and lesbian women in mind, the way they function fundamentally doesn't work with the way queer/trans folks date and socialize and these apps often end up alienating members of these communities. 
Our app takes into account that most of our target audience dates less focusing on searching within a certain gender group and more based on personal interests and comfort zones/past experiences. Therefore, the "traditional" (in most dating apps) method of selecting search parameters based on gender isn't the most effective way for our audience. Instead, the app will be text-based: members can make a post about who they are, what they're looking for, etc; these messages should stay up for 30 days maximum to make it easy for users to gauge how recent a communication was made. 

## Our MVP:
- App should have secure login and account creation (only 18+ allowed on the site, for safety purposes).
- Users should be able to post a new message from their own account
- Users should be able to privately message between themselves
- A flagging option on each post will allow each user to flag the post once if they feel it violates the rules of the site; when a post reaches a certain amount of flags, the post will be automatically removed.
- Users can like a post and it will be saved to their dashboard.
- Users can delete their own posts. 
- Users should be able to update their information. 
- The app will come with a base admin account. 

## Roles
All members have agreed that overlap in roles will ensure a more cohesive app. However, general roles are as follows: 

Mustafa - Lead front end designer. 
Sean - Security.
Jack - Routing/backend functionality.
Bailing - Databases, QA testing. 

## Mockups
Mustafa has created several mockups that reflect our different design options. A firm decision will be made after we have tested how the app looks in each design:

Bailing has made a couple as well:
